# WinterOfCode(ML)
This project has 6 models - Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, K- Nearest Neighbors, K- Means Clustering, Neural Networks. 
## Linear Regression
It is used to predict values of Y using fetures X. I made a function to train my model and get theta values. Then I used those theta to get Y for my testing data. Then I calculated Root Mean Squared Error.
#### Root Mean Squared Error = 1.829
## Polynomia Regression
It is used to predict values of Y using features and their nth degree. I started with n=2 and tried till n=4. I got maximum accuracy for n=3. Then, I made a function to train my model and get theta values.
